# Form Analysis of Beatles Songs
In this analysis we look at Beatles songs and categorise them into those with AABA form or verse-chorus form. Mid century pop songs tend to be AABA, whereas current (2023) pop songs tend to be verse-chorus. One is more 'sticky' than the other, and the transition period was arguably the mid 1950's (e.g. Rock Around The Clock Tonight) to the late 1960's, by which most pop songs were verse-chorus, with some beachheads of AABA songs (e.g. What A Wonderful World 1967). The Beatles straddled this period, with their constituents' teenage development years deeply entrenched in mind 1950's music, and an original catalog that spanned 1962 - 1970. Through their songs, we should be able to observe the continental drift from AABA to verse-chorus pop song forms.

## Technologies
Web scraping (from Wikipedia using Python & Beautiful Soup), data analysis (SQL and possibly R or Python Pandas), data visualisation (whatever happens to be the most appropriate when we get there.

## Methodology
1. Scrape Wikipedia for a list of all Beatles songs
2. Manually categorise them as AABA or verse-chorus form (might need a third "don't know" category, or even a fourth, e.g. 'The End')
3. Analyse the data
4. Visualise the data to illustrate the drift from AABA songs to verse-chours songs.
